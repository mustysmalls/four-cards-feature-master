## My process

The process for development involved laying out a markup first using HTML5 and styling using Grids mostly for layout.
It was small project which i needed to recover little skills i had leanrt a while back bofore losing momentum while learning.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow using media query

### What I learned

It was a small project and i was familiar with most of the code written.
one thing i learnt was outside developing the project, which was creating a repository on Github and deploying the page.

### Continued development

I am still not very familiar with the mobile first approach which involves developing for mobile first then working my way up.
I would definitely be putting in more effort into doing that, and definitely will definitely pick a more challenging project next time.

### Useful resources
